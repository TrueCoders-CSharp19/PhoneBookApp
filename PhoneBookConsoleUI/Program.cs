            1) Well presented, no bad formatting.

            3) Try to complete the baseline Features by 1 week.

            1) Create a contact
            2) Read all the contacts in the phonebook
            3) Update an existing contact
            4) Delete a contact

        /* Potential Other Features:      
            
            1) Saving user contacts to a file like JSON
            2) Saving the users contacts to a database
            3) Adding a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to the project
                        • For Windows apps, you would use win forms or WPF
                        • For Mac, you would need to research XCode
            4) Adding an API to do the REST commands from PostMan

        
            - I don't know anything about 1, 2, or 4, though I'm definitely
            open to learning about them. WinForms I've played with before. If we 
            want to tackle any of these after the baseline is completed I'm open 
            to that.

            How should we begin the project? I'd like to try and make use of abstract classes,
            method overloading, inheritance, and interfaces. What needs to be set up to begin testing
            and each tackling a feature?

            Classes to start with for baseline structure:

            •  Account 

                
            • Contact

        /* Collaboration
         
            Once we have finished discussing what the project will be and how we will start
            we should have a final version of this document with our outline pushed into our
            main branch on Github. 
        
            From there each of us should clone a copy of the project
            into their own branch on the same repo.

            Each of us can manage our branch however we wish, either in a singular
            branch or seperating into more branches per feature we work on.

            When a feature is ready to be added to the main project, we can create a new branch
            to merge both branches into, complete testing and ensure that everyone on the project
            is good with the code and functionality.

            Here we should list each feature as it is added to the project, one at a time with
            the owner of that feature listed. 
        
            Features should each be their own section so that you can record
            the history of your feature as you wish to there. Including dates is optional but
            may help to show your dedication to the project to a potential employer. 
        
            Completing dealines is a necessity in the workplace, and this is the opportunity
            to show an employer how you handle deadlines. However, this is still an optional
            project so treat it however you want to. This is just a guideline for trying to 
            make the most out of the project possible.
